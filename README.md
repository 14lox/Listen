iOS 7+ Music On-The-Go Playlist Player

![](Listen/Listen-Icon-120.png)

Yet to be released iOS app. 

The native iOS Music app has notorious problems with adding / removing / searching for other tracks whilst it's playing.

List.en solves this. And looks great too!

This is a work in progress - we plan to release it for free on the App Store soon.

Please feel free to get involved and help us improve it.
